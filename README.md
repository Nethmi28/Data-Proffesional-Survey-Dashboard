# Data Professional Global Survey Analysis
## An Interactive Power BI Dashboard exploring the 2024 Data Landscape

### 🌟 Project Overview
What does the "average" data professional actually look like? This project analyzes a comprehensive survey of 630 data professionals worldwide. The dashboard translates raw survey responses into actionable insights regarding salary benchmarks, programming language popularity, and job satisfaction across various roles.

### 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this dashboard is to provide a "state of the union" for the data industry. It helps aspiring data scientists and current professionals answer:

Which job titles command the highest average salary?

Which programming languages (Python, R, SQL, etc.) are actually used in the field?

How does professional happiness vary across different roles and regions?

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Process

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
•	📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br>
•	📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.<br>
•	🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br>
•	📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.<br>
•	📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

To ensure the data was accurate and readable, I followed a rigorous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process:

### 📊 Key Features & Visuals

     Language Popularity: A visual ranking of the most essential tools in a data professional's       toolkit.

4. Interactive Filters (Slicers)
     Users can filter the entire dashboard by Country, Education Level, or Current Job Title to see   specific sub-trends.

### 🏁 Final Conclusion<br>

Based on the data, individuals looking to maximize their career value should focus on mastering Python and aiming for Data Analyst,Data Engineer,Data Scientist,Data arachitect roles. The dashboard proves that the data profession is diverse, with a wide range of entry points and salary scales depending on technical specialization.
